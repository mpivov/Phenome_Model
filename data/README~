The input to the inference engine is a few different files that can be created from any EHR dataset.  The input files are in the "data" directory, the "examples" directory there is just a set of example data with which to run the inference enging.

--Vocabulary files --
diag_vocab.txt,med_vocab.txt,lab_vocab.txt,word_vocab.txt
Each of these files is a list of vocabulary terms for each data type for example.  Example files are located in "data/examples/"

--Count files--
diag_counts.txt,med_counts.txt,lab_counts.txt,word_counts.txt
Each of these files countains the count of each vocabulary term in each patient record.  All of these files should have the same patient order.
Example files are located in "data/examples"
