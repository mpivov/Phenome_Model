This directory has two types of files.

--Vocabulary files --
diag_vocab.txt,med_vocab.txt,lab_vocab.txt,word_vocab.txt
Each of these files is a list of vocabulary terms for each data type for example.  The diag_vocab.txt uses the ICD-9 hierarchy.


--Count files--
diag_counts.txt,med_counts.txt,lab_counts.txt,word_counts.txt
Each of these files countains the count of each vocabulary term in each patient record.  All of these files should have the same patient order.
For example, row: "1234, 2:1, 4:1, 2:1" stands for: "Patient 1234 had vocabulary term 2 mentioned once, vocabulary term 4 mentioned once and vocabulary term 2 mentioned 3 times."
